                <p  class="p-small">
                    These days, website builders such as Wix and SiteBuilder have made building websites easy. With a simple drag and drop interface and a variety of templates, anyone can build a website that is both functional and stylish.

                    But what if you’re not interested in having a website that looks just like everyone else’s? What happens when you want to make changes to your site that go beyond what’s available using the drag and drop builder?
                    
                    With a basic knowledge of HTML (as well as a little CSS), you can build a truly unique website that you can edit and update yourself, and you won’t have to pay expensive monthly service fees.
                    
                    Learning HTML is also considered the first step for progressing into more complex and in-demand programming languages. Fancy earning a six-figure salary as a web developer for a Silicon Valley startup? Or maybe you’ve got plans to develop the next Facebook or Twitter? If you’re interested in learning how to do any web related programming, HTML is the place to start. </p>
